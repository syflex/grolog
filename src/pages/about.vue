        Agrolog Limited (RC 1527119) is a newly established agribusiness company specialized in production and
        trade of agricultural commodities, agrologistics, various agricultural investment and farm management.
        Innovations that assure the delivery of wholesome food to consumers constitute the value proposition
        which AgroLog brings to its clients. Institutional voids constitute great impediments in food systems,
        creating chaos and disruptions in the ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The desire to address this has taken us back to the fundamentals of food production: THE FARM. 
        AgroLog seeks to entrench a culture of operational excellence that guarantees transparency from farm to table. 
        The primary objective is traceability that ensures the consumer not only know the source but the quality of food on the table.        
      </p>
      <p>        
        Consequently AgroLog has contrived partnerships through Innovation Platforms (IPs) that bring 
        farmers and investors together enabling ecosystems that allow for backward integration that 
        builds farmers capacities, flow of quality inputs, standardization of practices that ensure high 
        productivity and quality outputs.         
      </p>
      <p>
        On the forward integration front we work with partner clusters to achieve best practices in 
        postharvest handling that deliver quality to the table. Our initial focus is on vegetables but our 
        network is growing to include commodities across the spectrum of agribusiness.
        NO useless Mission Vision Goal and Objectives please! A visitor wants to see who we are and 
        what we do and how to contact us. Thatâ€™s all. No bullshitting please!
